## Anchore Enterprise 3.2.0

This release adds the V2 vulnerability scanner, based on Grype, which is set as the default for Anchore Enterprise. 

Version 3.2.0 also includes other improvements and fixes.

## New Features

### V2 scanner is now set as the default vulnerability scanner

Anchore Enterprise is fully integrated with Grype by default for vulnerability scanning. This Grype integration replaces the legacy vulnerability scanner in previous versions of Anchore Enterprise.

If you are currently running the legacy scanner, you will need to specify Grype as the ANCHORE_VULNERABILITIES_PROVIDER. Only new installations will default to Grype. 

See [V2 Vulnerability Scanner]({{<ref "/docs/overview/v2_scanner" >}}) for more information.

### Allow trigger IDs to be added to allow lists.

To allow list a package and version rule, a mechanism to allow list items other than vulnerabilities has been added to the app.

### Alpine matching against source package

Grype matches against source package information to reduce False Negatives and return more True Positives for Alpine images.

### Fixes

- Dependency updates to resolve non-impacting vulnerability findings
- Security vulnerability in package WS addressed

## Enterprise UI Changes

### Upgrading

Upgrading to Anchore Enterprise 3.2.0 involves a database upgrade that the system will handle itself. It may cause the upgrade to take several minutes.
