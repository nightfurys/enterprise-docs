## Anchore Enterprise 3.3.0

This release offers Rocky Linux support and various UI updates.

Version 3.3.0 also includes other improvements and fixes.

### Rocky Linux support

Anchore Enterprise can now scan Rocky Linux images for vulnerabilities. 

### Fixes
 
- Images that had Go content and hints enabled were failing analysis. This has been fixed.
- Images reported via runtime inventory that also had port numbers in the registry host URL were failing to parse properly, which caused scan failures. This issue has been fixed.
- NuGet packages were not matched to vulnerabilities correctly. This is now fixed.
- With the Grype provider, NVD and vendor CVSS scores were missing for records in non-NVD namespaces. This is now fixed.
- Migration code was added to clean-up the unused feed records, and fixed artifacts and vulnerabilities records for the github:os group.

### Known Issues

NVD CVSS scores are missing in the query vulnerabilities API with the Grype provider.

#### Problem 
The `/query/vulnerabilities` API response contains an `nvd_data` attribute for each vulnerability in the result. The value of the attribute represents the NVD assigned CVSS scores. This field is not correctly populating for a small subset of vulnerabilities in the system. Instead of a list of results, the value is a null reference as shown below. 
**Note:** This known issue only affects vulnerabilities that exclusively belong in the `nvd` namespace with Grype as the vulnerabilities provider (Next-gen v2 scanner). It does not affect the legacy vulnerability provider.

    % curl -u user:password "http://localhost:8228/v1/query/vulnerabilities?id=CVE-2019-15780"
    {
      "page": "1",

              "name": "formidable_form_builder",
              "type": "unknown",
              "version": "< 4.02.01",
              "will_not_fix": false
            }
          ],

              "url": "https://wordpress.org/plugins/formidable/#developers"
            },
            {
              "source": "N/A",
              "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Strategy11/formidable-forms/master/changelog.txt"
            },
            {

              "url": "https://pentest.co.uk/labs/advisory/cve-2019-15780/"
            },

              "url": "https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/9935"
            }
          ],
          "severity": "Critical",
          "vendor_data": []
        }
      ]
    }

#### Workaround

The API supports a namespace query parameter to filter results based on the namespace. Supply the namespace with an `nvd` value to view the NVD CVSS scores, as shown in the following example.

    % curl -u user:password "http://localhost:8228/v1/query/vulnerabilities?id=CVE-2019-15780&namespace=nvd"
    {
      "page": "1",
      "returned_count": 1,
      "total_count": 1,
      "vulnerabilities": [
        {
          "affected_packages": [
            {

              "type": "unknown",
              "version": "< 4.02.01",
              "will_not_fix": false
            }
          ],

    }


## Enterprise UI Changes

- Multi-image selection and deletion now possible for RepositoryView.
- The login page banner can now be edited. You can now edit the banner on the login page to provide customized information, such as how to log in, whether to use SSO or email addresses, and support contact information.
- Failed images can now be removed from a repository. 
- The context of the policy bundle test results view is now preserved as a user changes to different tabs. 

### Fixes

- JSON and CSV downloads from the **Policy Compliance** tab now include the policy bundle name and data.
- Compliance tables now correctly filter based on column data.

### Upgrading
Upgrading to Anchore Enterprise 3.3.0 involves a database upgrade that the system will handle itself. It may cause the upgrade to take several minutes.
