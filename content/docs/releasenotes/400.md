## Anchore Enterprise 4.0.0

The Anchore Enterprise 4.0.0 release offers significant new supply chain security features expanding the Anchore Enterprise SBOM management platform beyond container scanning. Users can now generate and continuously monitor SBOMs for their source code repositories to identify vulnerability and security risks. Policy rules that are specific to managing source code are now available in the Policy Engine. Multiple source code and container image SBOMs can also now be grouped together as an Application that can be managed as a single set enabling generation of SBOMs representing a total application or service. 

Additional new SBOM capabilities enable users to observe and limit SBOM drift between container image builds. Users can use policy rules to enforce immutable container best practices or help detect potentially malicious activity.

AnchoreCTL, the integration tool for use in CI/CD pipelines, has also been updated to include Source Repository Management.

A number of performance improvements have also been made to improve the response of the GUI, reporting service, as well as the efficiency of the queue processing processes.

Version 4.0.0 also includes other improvements and fixes.

### SBOM Management

You can now generate SBOMs using AnchoreCTL as part of a command line or CI/CD workflow, through pulling content from a registry, or by submitting an artifact to the Anchore API. 

SBOMs can be managed using the command line, API or GUI, where contents can be grouped together, annotated, viewed, or searched. Artifact metadata, vulnerability information, and policy evaluations can also be viewed and managed through the same interfaces.

All SBOMs can be downloaded into a variety of formats, either individually or collectively, to be sent to security teams, customers or end-users.

See [SBOM Generation and Management]({{<ref "/docs/sbom_magaement" >}}) for more information. 

### Applications

You can now build applications in Anchore Enterprise. Applications are the top-level building block in a hierarchical view, containing artifacts like packages or image artifacts. Applications can represent any project your teams deliver. Each application is associated with one or more application versions which track the specific grouping of artifacts that comprise a product version. 

Anchore Enterprise lets you model your versioned applications to create a comprehensive view of the vulnerability and security health of the projects your teams are building across the breadth of your Software Delivery Lifecycle. 

By grouping related components into applications, and updating those components across application versions as projects grow and change, you can get a holistic view of the current and historic security health of the applications from development through built image artifacts.

See [Anchore Enterprise Application Groups]({{<ref "/docs/sbom_magaement/application_groups" >}}) for more information.

### SBOM Drift

You can now set triggers for policy violations on changes in the SBOM between images, with the same tag, so that it can detect drift over time between builds of your images. 

The triggers are:
image_diff_packages_added
image_diff_packages_removed
image_diff_packages_modified

See [SBOM Generation and Management]({{<ref "/docs/sbom_magaement" >}}) for more information.

### Legacy vulnerability Scanner No Longer Supported

The legacy vulnerability scanner is no longer included as an option when installing or upgrading Anchore Enterprise. 

If you currently have Enterprise configured to use the legacy vulnerability scanner, you will not be able to successfully upgrade and start the system without explicitly configuring the default vulnerability scanner. 

You can remove that configuration variable so the system can default to the current vulnerability scanner.

If you choose not to upgrade, instead performing a new installation of Enterprise, the vulnerability scanner will be configured by default.


### Fixes
 
- Resolved data leaks from the grypedb feeds driver that could occur when process terminated by OS.
- Resolved reporting service refresh issue. 
- Report manager now returns preview results in v3.3 with the Grype vulnerability provider.
- Reporting service no longer looks at or attempts to refesh deleted image data. Reporting procedures now operate on data sets where the analysis state is analyzed and image state is active.
- Reporting service delays with data collection have been fixed.
- There was an issue with the Debian driver  providing empty content. The grype-db-builder now builds all Debian data in the feeds service.


### Known Issue

- The NVD CVSS scores known issue from the 3.3.0 release has been fixed. NVD CVSS scores are now present in the API responses for the request to get a detailed information query about a vulnerability feed record.


## Enterprise UI Changes

- New **Applications** tab. Observe applications in Enterprise and see a summary of the applications that have been collected into an application. From the application view, you can drill down into the source repositories or container images that make up the application, and browse their SBOMS.
- View applications and application versions from source repositories and image containers. The information is categorized by applications, with sub-categories of application versions available.
- You can download a report in JSON format for everything in an application. 
- View information about an artifact, such as the policies set up, the vulnerabilities, SBOM contents,and metadata information.
- From the **Policies** tab, set up policies and policy bundles for source repository or container images, as well as mappings for an artifact. 



### Fixes

- 

### Upgrading
Upgrading to Anchore Enterprise 4.0.0 involves a database upgrade that the system will handle itself. It may cause the upgrade to take several minutes.

If you currently have Enterprise configured to use the legacy vulnerability scanner, you will not be able to successfully upgrade and start the system without explicitly configuring the default vulnerability scanner. 

You can remove that configuration variable so the system can default to the current vulnerability scanner.

If you choose not to upgrade, instead performing a new installation of Enterprise, the vulnerability scanner will be configured by default.

## AnchoreCTL

The latest version of AnchoreCTL is **0.1.3**.
AnchoreCTL is dependent on Syft **v0.20.0** as a library.

The current features that are supported are as follows:
- Compliance Reports: View and operate on runtime compliance reports, such as STIGs, created by the `rem` tool.
- Corrections Management: View and modify corrections information to help reduce false positives in your vulnerability results. 
- Source Repository Management: Generate an application or artifact, and import them from a source repository. Get information about  the source repository, investigate vulnerability packages by requesting vulnerabilities for a single analyzed source repository, or get any policy evaluations.
- Image Management: View, list, import local analysis, and request image analysis by the system.
- Runtime Inventory Management: Add, update, and view cluster configurations for Anchore to scan, as well as for the inventory reports themselves.
- System Operations: View and manage system information for your Enterprise deployment.
