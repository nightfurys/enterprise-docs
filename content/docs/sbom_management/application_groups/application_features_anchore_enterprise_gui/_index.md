Anchore Enterprise lets you use the UI to see a summary of the applications available from source repositories. You can perform an analysis of the application and artifact data. 

Additionally, you can set your policies and mappings for a source repository, similar to how you set them up for images. See [SBOM Management]({{< ref "/docs/sbom_management" >}}) for more information.
