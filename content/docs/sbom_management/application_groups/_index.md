Anchore Enterprise lets you model your versioned applications to create a comprehensive view of the vulnerability and security health of the projects your teams are building across the breadth of your Software Delivery Lifecycle. 

By grouping related components into applications, and updating those components across application versions as projects grow and change, you can get a holistic view of the current and historic security health of the applications from development through built image artifacts.

The typical flow is:
- An application will be created for each project that you want to track.
- Versions will be created both for the current in-development version and for previous versions. 
- Artifacts will be grouped together under those application versions. 

Applications, application versions, and artifact associations can be managed via either the applications API or AnchoreCTL.
