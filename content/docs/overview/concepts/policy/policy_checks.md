## Introduction

In this document, we describe the current anchore gates (and related triggers/parameters) that are supported within anchore policy bundles.  If you have a running anchore enterprise, this information can also be obtained using the CLI:

`# anchore-cli policy describe (--gate <gatename> ( --trigger <triggername))`

### Gate: dockerfile

Checks against the content of a dockerfile if provided, or a guessed dockerfile based on docker layer history if the dockerfile is not provided.

| Trigger Name | Description | Parameter | Description | Example |
| :----------- | :---------- | :-------- | :---------- | :------ |
| instruction | Triggers if any directives in the list are found to match the described condition in the dockerfile. | instruction | The Dockerfile instruction to check. | from |
| instruction | Triggers if any directives in the list are found to match the described condition in the dockerfile. | check | The type of check to perform. | = |
| instruction | Triggers if any directives in the list are found to match the described condition in the dockerfile. | value | The value to check the dockerfile instruction against. | scratch |
| instruction | Triggers if any directives in the list are found to match the described condition in the dockerfile. | actual_dockerfile_only | Only evaluate against a user-provided dockerfile, skip evaluation on inferred/guessed dockerfiles. Default is False. | true |
| effective_user | Checks if the effective user matches the provided user names, either as a allowlist or blocklist depending on the type parameter setting. | users | User names to check against as the effective user (last user entry) in the images history. | root,docker |
| effective_user | Checks if the effective user matches the provided user names, either as a allowlist or blocklist depending on the type parameter setting. | type | How to treat the provided user names. | blocklist |
| exposed_ports | Evaluates the set of ports exposed. Allows configuring allowlist or blocklist behavior. If type=whitelist, then any ports found exposed that are not in the list will cause the trigger to fire. If type=blacklist, then any ports exposed that are in the list will cause the trigger to fire. | ports | List of port numbers. | 80,8080,8088 |
| exposed_ports | Evaluates the set of ports exposed. Allows configuring allowlist or blocklist behavior. If type=whitelist, then any ports found exposed that are not in the list will cause the trigger to fire. If type=blacklist, then any ports exposed that are in the list will cause the trigger to fire. | type | Whether to use port list as a allowlist or blocklist. | blacklist |
| exposed_ports | Evaluates the set of ports exposed. Allows configuring allowlist or blocklist behavior. If type=whitelist, then any ports found exposed that are not in the list will cause the trigger to fire. If type=blacklist, then any ports exposed that are in the list will cause the trigger to fire. | actual_dockerfile_only | Only evaluate against a user-provided dockerfile, skip evaluation on inferred/guessed dockerfiles. Default is False. | true |
| no_dockerfile_provided | Triggers if anchore analysis was performed without supplying the actual image Dockerfile. | | | |
