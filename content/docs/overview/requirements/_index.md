## Introduction

This section details the requirements to run Anchore Enterprise.

### Database

Anchore Enterprise requires a PostgreSQL version 9.6 or higher database to provide persistent storage for image, policy and analysis data.

The database can be run in a container, as configured in the example Docker Compose file, or it can be provided as an external service to Anchore Enterprise.
PostgreSQL compatible databases, such as Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL, can be used for highly-scalable cloud deployments.

### Memory

The Anchore Enterprise container will typically operate at a steady state that uses less than 2 GB of memory. However, under load, and during large feed synchronization operations, memory usage may spike above 4GB. Therefore, for production deployments, a minimum of 8GB is recommended for each service.

### Network

Anchore requires the following two categories of network access:

- Registry Access
    Network connectivity, including DNS resolution, to the registries from which Anchore Enterprise needs to download images.
- Feed Service
    Anchore Enterprise synchronizes feed data such as operating system vulnerabilities (CVEs) from the Anchore Cloud Service. The initial synchronization may take 5 to 10 minutes, based on network speed, after which time Anchore Enterprise will download updated feed data at a user-configurable interval, by default every 4 hours. Only a single end point is required for this synchronization. 
    host: ancho.re 
    TCP port: 443

### Security

Anchore Enterprise is deployed as container images that can be run manually using Docker Compose, Kubernetes or any container platform that supports Docker compatible images.

By default, Anchore Enterprise does not require any special permissions. It can be run as an unprivileged container with no access to the underlying Docker host. 

**Note:** Anchore Enterprise can be configured to pull images through the Docker Socket. However, this configuration is not recommended, as it grants the Anchore Enterprise container added privileges, and may incur a performance impact on the Docker Host.

### Storage

Anchore Enterprise uses a PostgreSQL database to store persistent data for images, tags, policies, subscriptions and other artifacts. One persistent storage volume is required for configuration information, and two optional storage volumes may be provided as described below.

- **Configuration volume**
    This volume is used to provide persistent storage to the container from which it will read its configuration files, and optionally - certificates. *Requirement*: Less than 1MB.
- [Optional] **Temporary storage**
    The temporary storage volume is recommended but not required. During the analysis of images, Anchore Enterprise downloads and extracts all of the layers required for an image. These layers are extracted and analyzed, after which, the layers and extracted data are deleted. If a temporary storage is not configured, then the container's ephemeral storage will be used to store temporary files. However, performance is likely be improved by using a dedicated volume. A temporary storage volume may also be used for image-layer caching to speed up analysis. *Requirement*: Three times the uncompressed image size to be analyzed. 
    *Note*: A temporary volume is required to work around a kernel driver bug for container hosts that use OverlayFS or OverlayFS2 storage, with a kernel older than 4.13.
- [Optional] **Object storage**
    Anchore Enterprise stores documents containing archives of image analysis data and policies as JSON documents. By default these documents are be stored within the PostgreSQL database, however Anchore Enterprise can be configured to store archive documents in a filesystem (volume), S3 Object store, or Swift Object Store. *Requirement*: Number of images x 10MB (estimated).

### Enterprise UI 

The Anchore Enterprise User Interface is delivered as a Docker container that can be run on any Docker compatible runtime. 

The Anchore Enterprise UI module interfaces with Anchore API using the external API endpoint. The UI requires access to the Anchore database where it creates its own namespace for persistent configuration storage. Additionaly, a Redis DB is used to store session information. 

- Runtime
    - Docker compatible runtime (version 1.12 or higher)

- Storage
    - Configuration volume This volume is used to provide persistent storage to the container from which it will read its configuration files and optionally certificates.
    Requirement: Less than 1MB
      
- Network
    - Ingress
        - The Anchore UI module publishes a web UI service by default on port 3000 however this port can be remapped.
    - Engress
        - The Anchore UI module requires access to two network services: 
            - External API endpoint (typically port 8228)
            - Redis Database (typically port 6379)

- Redis Service
    - Version 4 or higher

**Note:** If you're installing the Anchore Enterprise UI using our installation examples, they include a deployment of a redis service as part of the UI deployment process.
